	TFU	-	Tek File Upload
===================================================
A Script for managing and uploading files, written in PHP.

Setup:

1. Create a folder outside the web directory
2. Move info.php and users.dat to that directory
3. Edit the information in info.php to match your configuration
4. Edit the right location of info.php to the 2nd line of file.php
5. Create the folder in which the files are saved
6. You should be ready to go. If the script doesn't work, check the file folders rights
